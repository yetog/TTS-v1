Action Plan for TTS App Development
This plan outlines the key phases of development, ensuring a structured approach to building Version 1 (MVP) and later integrating advanced features.

🚀 Phase 1: Research & Planning (1-2 Weeks)
Goals:
Define clear requirements.
Research available TTS APIs and offline engines.
Design user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) flow.
Tasks:
✅ Choose core TTS engines: Pyttsx3 (offline), gTTS, Coqui, NaturalReader API.
✅ Define file handling strategy: PDF, Word, text files.
✅ Sketch wireframes for the Streamlit UI.
✅ Identify security measures (storing API keys in .env or cloud secret managers).
✅ Plan folder structure for project organization.

⚙️ Phase 2: Backend Development (3-4 Weeks)
Goals:
Implement TTS processing for text input and basic document upload.
Set up caching to avoid redundant processing.
Tasks:
✅ Text-to-Speech Core Functions

Process plain text input using selected TTS engines.
Implement say() function to generate and save audio.
✅ Basic File Handling (Version 1)

Support uploading text files (.txt).
Extract and process text.
✅ Caching Mechanism

Implement local caching to avoid reprocessing the same text.
Store MP3 files temporarily.
✅ Secure API Keys

Use .env files to store sensitive keys.
Implement error handling for missing/invalid API keys.
🖥️ Phase 3: Frontend & UI (3-4 Weeks)
Goals:
Build a simple UI in Streamlit for text input & playback.
Allow users to upload documents and play/download audio.
Tasks:
✅ UI Elements

Text input field.
File upload button.
Dropdown for voice selection.
Audio player for playback controls (play, pause, stop).
✅ Backend Integration

Connect UI to TTS processing logic.
Implement real-time audio generation & playback.
✅ Basic Folder Structure for Files

Organize uploaded documents and generated audio files.
🚀 Phase 4: Testing & Refinement (2-3 Weeks)
Goals:
Ensure smooth text-to-audio conversion.
Optimize UI usability and API performance.
Tasks:
✅ Test TTS accuracy and speed with different voices.
✅ Fix UI bugs and improve file handling.
✅ Add logging for debugging failed requests or missing files.

📢 Phase 5: Deployment & Version 1 Launch (1-2 Weeks)
Goals:
Deploy a working MVP (Version 1) with text input, basic document support, and playback.
Host the app on Streamlit Cloud / Flask-FastAPI backend.
Tasks:
✅ Optimize for low-latency processing.
✅ Deploy using Docker (optional).
✅ Collect user feedback for improvements.

🔥 Phase 6: Advanced Features (Post Launch)
Goals:
Add document handling (PDF, Word).
Implement folder management for file organization.
Improve caching and API switching.
Tasks:
✅ Document Handling Expansion

Add PyMuPDF, pdfminer.six, python-docx to extract text from PDFs and Word documents.
Improve text extraction accuracy.
✅ Folder Management

Allow users to create folders for better organization.
Implement a simple database (SQLite / Firebase) for metadata tracking.
✅ More TTS Options

Add offline support with Pyttsx3 and Coqui.
Allow users to switch between TTS providers dynamically.
✅ Security Enhancements

Use AWS Secrets Manager / Azure Key Vault for API keys.
✅ Performance Optimization

Improve caching strategy for repeat requests.
Implement MP3 download optimization.
✅ Deployment Options

Migrate to FastAPI + React (for a long-term scalable solution).
